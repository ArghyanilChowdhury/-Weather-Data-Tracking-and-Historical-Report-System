The aim of this practical is to develop a weather data tracking and retrieval system that 
fetches real-time weather information for specified cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
The project enables storage of weather data in JSON format, allowing users to access both 
current weather conditions and historical records. Additionally, the system provides 
functionality to search and display past weather reports by city, date, or date range, 
facilitating easy access to comprehensive weather information.
